                            <h2>Maple Leaf Foods to open new London plant, while 3 others to close</h2>
                            <p class="description">Maple Leaf Foods has announced plans to build a $660-million fresh poultry facility south of Hwy. 401 in London, with doors set to open in 2021.</p>
                            <p><b>The new 640,00</b> square-foot facility will employ 1,450 people, but comes with job losses in three other Ontario centres.</p>
                            <p><b>Maple Leaf processing plants in Toronto</b>, Brampton and Perth South, near the community of St. Marys, will close as the company consolidates operations.</p>
                            <p><b>McCain said that, on top of the $660 million investment</b>, Maple Leaf has also pledged to spend another $5 million to accelerate adoption of advanced manufacturing technology and reduce the company's environmental footprint by 50 per cent.</p>
                            <p><b>Ford also took the rare opportunity to congratulate his federal counterparts</b>, who had been working on bringing Maple Leaf Foods to London for years, along with city officials and the former Liberal government of Ontario. </p>
                            <p><b>"Good job," he said.</b> "Remember, Doug Ford is telling the Liberals, good job." Ford also pledged to lower electricity rates by 12 per cent and remove the number of regulations on businesses in Ontario by 25 per cent. </p>
