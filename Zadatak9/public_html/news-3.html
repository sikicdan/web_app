                            <h2>Canada's long history with Commonwealth Games in danger of being over</h2>
                            <p class="description">Canadian Foundation needs to raise $800,000 over the next 4 years.</p>
                            <p><b>Uncharacteristically, an increasing number of asks</b> from what has become an international movement of benevolence, are coming from sport. </p>
                            <p><b>There are local sports organizations soliciting</b> support as well as major corporations who create opportunity for less fortunate kids on various fields of play. Now there are even a number of requests from Canada's high-performance athletes themselves.</p>
                            <p><b>One striking example is the Commonwealth Games Foundation of Canada's initiative</b>, which comes in the form of an athlete-led, public-fundraising campaign hoping to ensure our country's long-term survival in these major multi-sport Games.</p>
                            <p><b>The Commonwealth Games were launched in Hamilton, Ont., in 1930 as the British Empire Games</b>, and in the modern era bring together top-flight athletes from more than 70 countries and territories who share a common language and heritage. The level of competition at these Games, which showcases the core summer sports like athletics, aquatics, gymnastics, cycling, and wrestling, is second only to the Olympics.</p>
                            <p><b>But at the latest edition of the Games this past summer in Gold Coast</b>, Australia, a sizeable portion of the Canadian team that competed was forced to, at least partially, pay its own freight. </p>
