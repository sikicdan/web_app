                            <h2>What you need to know about the Grey Cup</h2>
                            <p class="description">The CFL championship game kicks off Sunday at 6 p.m. ET in Edmonton. Whether you're an avid fan or you just got invited to a Grey Cup party and want to feel in the loop, here are some basics to get you set for the game:</p>
                            <p><b>Calgary is the favourite.</b> But that hasn't helped them the last two years. Bookies have the Stampeders favoured by four points over the Ottawa Redblacks. So, if you bet on Calgary using the point spread, they have to win by five in order for you to collect. If your money's on Ottawa, they can win the game outright or lose by up to three points (if Calgary wins by four, everybody gets their money back). The Stamps hope the third time's a charm — they were also favoured to beat Toronto last year and Ottawa the year before, and they were upset both times.</p>
                            <p><b>The Stampeders have the CFL's top player.</b> Quarterback Bo Levi Mitchell won the Most Outstanding Player award after throwing for a league-best 35 touchdowns in the regular season. He also won it in 2016.</p>
                            <p><b>But the Redblacks have the top Canadian.</b> Receiver Brad Sinopoli won his second outstanding Canadian award after making 116 catches — the most ever in a single season by a player from north of the border.</p>
                            <p><b>And Ottawa also has the best feel-good story.</b> Kicker Lewis Ward was named the CFL's top rookie and special-teams player. He made an astounding 51 of his 52 field-goal tries (that's a league-record 98.1 per cent) and enjoyed a streak of 48 (!) straight regular-season makes. All that by a guy who was on the sidelines for last year's Grey Cup game… working as a security guard.</p>
                            <p><b>The halftime act is Canadian singer Alessia Cara.</b> If you don't know her, you've probably heard her songs Here and Scars To Your Beautiful. They're on the radio a lot. Canadian country artist Brett Kissel is doing the national anthem."</p>
